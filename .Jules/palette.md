# Palette's Journal

## Critical Learnings Only

⚠️ ONLY add journal entries when you discover:
- An accessibility issue pattern specific to this app's components
- A UX enhancement that was surprisingly well/poorly received
- A rejected UX change with important design constraints
- A surprising user behavior pattern in this app
- A reusable UX pattern for this design system

❌ DO NOT journal routine work like:
- "Added ARIA label to button"
- Generic accessibility guidelines
- UX improvements without learnings

Format: `## YYYY-MM-DD - [Title]
**Learning:** [UX/a11y insight]
**Action:** [How to apply next time]`

## 2024-05-24 - Interactive Card Accessibility
**Learning:** "Card" style interactive elements often get implemented as divs, breaking keyboard navigation.
**Action:** Use `<button>` tags for interactive cards and use CSS (appearance: none, width: 100%, text-align: left) to strip default button styling while preserving accessibility.
