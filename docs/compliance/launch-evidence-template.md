## Appendix A — Current baseline snapshot (2026-02-14, local execution)

> This section is intentionally retained to seed the first audit packet and should be copied into the release-specific evidence file.

### A.1 Command outcomes observed
- `npm run check` → **FAIL**  
  - `CredVerseIssuer 3/server/services/queue-service.ts(204,64): error TS2339: Property 'attemptsMade' does not exist on type '{ jobId: string; failedReason: string; prev?: string | undefined; }'.`
- `npm run test` → **INCOMPLETE / NOT FINALIZED**  
  - Wallet + Issuer suites passed in the observed run; full monorepo command was interrupted before completion during Recruiter stage (no final exit code recorded).
- `set -a; source .env.launch.local; set +a; npm run gate:launch:strict` → **PASS**
- `npm run gate:foundation` → **FAIL** (`fetch failed`, services not up)
- `npm run gate:foundation:local` → **FAIL** (`POST /api/wallet/credentials` returned `401 No token provided`)
- `npm run gate:contracts:security` → **PASS** (Solhint + Hardhat compile + 28 contract tests)

### A.2 Residual risk snapshot
- `R-BASE-01` Type-checking gate broken in issuer queue service (`attemptsMade` typing mismatch).
- `R-BASE-02` Foundation E2E launch criterion currently failing (`wallet/credentials` auth failure in local orchestrated gate).
- `R-BASE-03` Test environment relies on development fallbacks in multiple services (JWT/VC key encryption/DigiLocker/Redis warnings), requiring production-env proof for audit closure.
