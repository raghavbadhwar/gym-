# NOVA Trust Interop Compatibility Matrix — 2026-02-18

## Scope
- `@credverse/trust` SDK contracts
- Cross-service contract flow: wallet ↔ issuer ↔ recruiter ↔ shared packages
- Interop lane: `npm run gate:nova:interop`

## Fix Applied
### Contract drift fixed
- **File:** `packages/shared-auth/src/contracts.ts`
- **Change:** Added missing proof format to canonical contract enum:
  - `ProofFormatContract`: added `'ldp_vc'`
- **Why:** Recruiter proof verification route already accepts `'ldp_vc'`, but shared contract type excluded it, creating enum/type drift across services.

## Compatibility Matrix

| Surface | Canonical Contract | Wallet (BlockWalletDigi) | Issuer (CredVerseIssuer 3) | Recruiter (CredVerseRecruiter) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Reputation event ingestion | `ReputationEventContract` | Produces/consumes via `@credverse/trust` and local fallback | `/reputation/events` normalizes snake/camel payloads | N/A | ✅ Compatible |
| Reputation score | `ReputationScoreContract` | `GET /v1/reputation/score` via SDK, fallback local compute | `/reputation/score` returns 0-1000 with category breakdown | Consumes summary outputs | ✅ Compatible |
| SafeDate score | `SafeDateScoreContract` | `GET /v1/reputation/safedate` via SDK/fallback | `/reputation/safedate` computes contract breakdown | WorkScore/SafeDate routes aligned to shared-auth | ✅ Compatible |
| Candidate summary decision | `VerificationDecision` = `approve/review/investigate/reject` | Maps scores + reason codes to contract decision | N/A (upstream score producer) | `buildCandidateSummaryContract` emits canonical decision set | ✅ Compatible |
| Proof generation request/result | `ProofGeneration*Contract` | SDK `generateProof()` hits issuer `/api/v1/proofs/generate` | Supports `merkle-membership`, handles unsupported formats deterministically | N/A | ✅ Compatible |
| Proof verification request/result | `ProofVerification*Contract` | SDK `verifyProof()` hits recruiter `/v1/proofs/verify` | N/A | Accepts and validates proof contract payloads | ✅ Compatible |
| Proof format enum | `ProofFormatContract` | Uses shared-auth via trust-sdk types | Uses shared-auth contracts | Accepts `sd-jwt-vc`, `jwt_vp`, `ldp_vp`, `ldp_vc`, `merkle-membership` | ✅ **Fixed drift** |
| Reason codes | `ReasonCode` (open string + known values) | Normalizes to uppercase tokens | Emits lowercase operational reason codes in reputation score/safedate | Emits risk/reason code arrays for verification outputs | ✅ Compatible (by open string contract) |

## Verification Runs

### Interop lane
- `npm run gate:nova:interop` → **PASS**
  - trust-sdk verify contract conformance ✅
  - wallet consumer reputation contract conformance ✅
  - issuer reputation graph contract conformance ✅
  - recruiter workscore + safedate contract conformance ✅

### Type/build checks
- `npm run check` → **PASS** (shared-auth, trust-sdk, wallet, issuer, recruiter)

### Full monorepo tests
- `npm test` → **PASS**
  - wallet, issuer, recruiter, gateway, mobile, contracts, trust-sdk all green

## Notes
- Observed deferred/blockchain warning logs are expected in local/test mode and did not affect contract compatibility.
- No additional contract or import/export mismatches found after enum fix.
