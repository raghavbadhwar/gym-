## 1. Reputation Rail (Core New Feature)

### What It Is
Cross-platform trust reputation system that allows users to carry their verified behavior, ratings, and credentials across ALL platforms they use.

### How It Works
```
User links accounts → Platforms write reputation events → 
User controls sharing → Other platforms read reputation → 
Network effects strengthen
```

### Reputation Score (0-1000)
Calculated from:
- Transport (Uber/Ola): 15% weight
- Accommodation (Airbnb): 15%
- Delivery (Swiggy/Zomato): 10%
- Employment (LinkedIn): 20%
- Finance (Credit proxy): 15%
- Social (Dating behavior): 10%
- Identity (Verification completeness): 15%

### Anti-Gaming
- Platform-signed events (only verified platforms can write)
- Blockchain anchoring of all reputation events
- ML fraud detection for suspicious patterns
- Dispute resolution system
- Time-decay function

### Business Model
- Platform API access: ₹50K-2L/year base
- Per-reputation-read: ₹2-5
- Per-reputation-write: ₹10-15
- Target: 30 platforms by Year 2 = ₹3 Cr ARR
