# CredVerse Agent Team (Function-Based + Service Liaisons)

**Date:** 2026-02-13

## 1) Team Topology and Shared Rules

We use a function-based core team with explicit service liaisons so every product has a clear point of contact while standards stay consistent across the monorepo. Each functional agent owns their discipline across the whole repo and is assigned one or two services as liaison owners (Issuer, Recruiter, Wallet, Gateway, Mobile, plus shared-auth). Liaisons are not exclusive owners; they are responsible for cross-service handoffs, release readiness, and catching product-specific edge cases.

Shared rules for all agents:
- Keep server/client separation in `credverse-gateway` and `BlockWalletDigi`.
- Prefer `packages/shared-auth` over reimplementing auth.
- Do not introduce mock data unless explicitly asked.
- Respect production Cloud Run flags: `REQUIRE_DATABASE=true`, `REQUIRE_QUEUE=true`, `ALLOW_DEMO_ROUTES=false`.
- Treat Vite client/server as separate dev processes per service scripts.
- Document decisions that change requirements in `docs/plans`.
- Keep work aligned to the Credity (India Stack-native trust layer) positioning.

Service liaison mapping:
- Issuer: Backend Lead, Data/ML Lead
- Recruiter: Frontend Lead, QA Lead
- Wallet (web): Frontend Lead, Security Lead
- Gateway: Platform/DevOps Lead, Product Lead
- Mobile: Mobile Lead, UX Lead
- shared-auth: Backend Lead, Security Lead

## 3) Team Cadence

- Weekly functional sync per discipline.
- Biweekly cross-functional release readiness review.
- Monthly architecture and security audit.

## 4) Success Metrics (Team Level)

- Release success rate (no rollback) >= 95%.
- P0 incident response time <= 30 minutes.
- Test coverage on critical flows >= 80%.
- Verified credential flow completion rate >= 90%.

## 5) Auto-Select Routing Contract

Every incoming task must be auto-routed with a deterministic score-based process:

1. Detect primary intent (product, UX, frontend, mobile, backend, data/ML, security, QA, DevOps, integration, docs, compliance, growth, support, release).
2. Score each role:
- +100 explicit role mention
- +60 path or file match (for example `apps/mobile`, `server/routes`, `docs/openapi`)
- +20 per trigger keyword (max +60)
- +20 explicit liaison service mention
- +15 role-specific deliverable mention (for example rollback plan, test matrix, DPIA, runbook)
3. Assign highest score as Primary Role.
4. Add up to two collaborator roles if score delta is <= 20 and workstreams are independent.
5. Use tie-breakers:
- implementation role over advisory role
- security/compliance over speed if risk is high
- QA over release for go/no-go
- Product Lead as final fallback
6. Choose execution mode:
- Single-agent mode for tightly coupled work.
- Swarm mode for 2+ independent workstreams with explicit lane ownership.

Mandatory response contract:
- Start with `🤖 [Role Name] responding:`
- Include `[Invoking: ...]`
- Include `[Using tools: ...]`
- Include `[Swarm mode: disabled|enabled (...lane owners...)]`

## 6) Dynamic Skill + Tool Selection Rules

### 6.1 Skill Selection Rules

For each task, agents choose only the needed skills (typically 1-4):
- New feature/design work: start with `brainstorming`.
- Bugs/failures/incidents: include `systematic-debugging`.
- Code changes: include `clean-code` or `test-driven-development`.
- Completion/release claims: include `verification-before-completion`.
- Uncertainty about workflow: include `using-superpowers`.

### 6.2 Tool Selection Rules

Tools are chosen per task stage:
- Discovery: repo search and file inspection.
- Implementation: code editing/refactoring.
- Validation: tests, lint, typecheck.
- Runtime debugging: logs and reproduction scripts.
- UI validation: browser automation/screenshots/accessibility checks.
- API validation: endpoint and schema checks.
- Release ops: git/CI/deploy/rollback checks.
- Documentation: markdown/spec updates.

Risk-based requirement:
- Security/auth/infra/compliance/release tasks must include validation before completion.

### 6.3 Swarm and Inter-Agent Messaging Rules

When tasks can be split safely into independent lanes:
- Use `dispatching-parallel-agents` to create parallel workstreams.
- Use `role-assigner` to choose lane owners by role fit.
- Use `agent-message-bus` for all lane handoffs and status updates.
- Use `workflow-orchestrator` for fan-out/fan-in dependencies.
- Use `consensus-engine` when collaborators disagree on a blocking decision.

Required message fields for every lane update:
- `workstream_id`, `from`, `to`, `type`, `priority`, `payload.content`, `requires_ack`, `thread_id`.

Minimum status events:
- `started`, `blocked`, `completed`.
