# Product Memory — Ingest Snapshot

## Product State
- Positioning: trust verification + fraud prevention platform for India-first enterprise workflows.
- Pillars: issuer, wallet, recruiter, gateway.
- Brand/UX uplift has already started (multiple gateway redesign iterations).

## Current Product Risks
- Visual and narrative consistency may still be uneven across surfaces.
- Recruiter and issuer explanation clarity must stay high for trust-critical workflows.
- Need measurable conversion and funnel telemetry to validate UX improvements.

## Product Priorities
1. Close P0 flow clarity gaps (issuer->wallet->recruiter golden path).
2. Drive website hierarchy and conversion quality to 7+ now.
3. Maintain evidence-backed scorecard updates.
