# Engineering Memory — Ingest Snapshot

## Project Object
- project_name: Credity monorepo platform hardening
- department_owner: Engineering & Development
- current_stage: Late integration + release hardening
- key_blockers:
  - foundation gate nonce mismatch in OID4VP response flow
  - stale hosted launch/contract evidence relative to release head
- next_actions:
  1. Reproduce and patch nonce mismatch deterministically.
  2. Re-run foundation gate local + hosted equivalent evidence.
  3. Refresh workflow_dispatch for launch-gate and contract-security on current SHA.
  4. Update release board with linked artifacts.
- expected_business_impact: unlocks GO decision path and reduces launch risk.

## Technical Notes
- Root scripts support check/test/gates/perf/security/evidence-pack.
- Multi-service topology is integrated enough for cross-service e2e and sepolia smoke patterns.
