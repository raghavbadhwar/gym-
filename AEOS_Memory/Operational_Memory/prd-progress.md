# PRD Progress (Evidence-Only)

## Method (strict)
- We count PRD **Feature Requirements** items (e.g., `#### Feature X: ...`) as the unit of progress.
- A feature is **DONE** only if:
  - the user-visible flow exists, AND
  - tests/gates or documented evidence exist in-repo (`swarm/reports`, CI evidence, or reproducible commands).
- Otherwise it is **PARTIAL** (some capability exists) or **NOT_STARTED**.

## Current Snapshot (2026-02-15)
- Status: **Baseline initialized** (first pass, conservative)

### High-confidence DONE
- None marked DONE yet (pending a full feature-by-feature evidence audit).

### High-confidence PARTIAL (evidence seen)
- Onboarding/Auth foundations exist across services (root gates + service tests referenced in release docs).
- Issuer → Wallet → Recruiter E2E proof/metadata flow validated in repo evidence (see `VALIDATION_CHECKLIST_P0_E2E.md` and release board artifacts).
- Gateway public surface + Ops dashboard shipped and deployed.

### High-confidence NOT_STARTED / Out-of-scope for current repo state
- Reputation Rail (cross-platform trust), SafeDate, Gig onboarding packs (PRD sections are specified but not evidenced as shipped).

## Update Snapshot (2026-02-17)
- Status: **Execution resumed under 60h full-PRD push** with new evidence on Reputation/SafeDate lanes.

### Newly evidenced PARTIAL progress
- **Reputation Rail (Cross-Platform Trust)**
  - Issuer: Neo4j-backed graph service implementation and route integration (`/reputation/events` graph writes + `/reputation/graph/snapshot`).
  - Evidence:
    - `CredVerseIssuer 3/tests/reputation-graph.test.ts`
    - `CredVerseIssuer 3/tests/reputation-graph-event-mapper.test.ts`
    - `CredVerseIssuer 3/tests/reputation-route-graph.test.ts`
- **SafeDate Score (Dating Safety Layer)**
  - Wallet: backend summary and safe-date flows now support trust-sdk live path with deterministic local fallback.
  - Evidence:
    - `BlockWalletDigi/tests/reputation-route-summary.test.ts`
    - `BlockWalletDigi/tests/reputation-preview-fallback.test.ts`
    - `BlockWalletDigi/tests/reputation-rail.test.ts`

### Validation commands (recent)
- `cd "CredVerseIssuer 3" && npm test -- tests/reputation-*.test.ts && npm run check`
- `cd BlockWalletDigi && npm test -- tests/reputation-route-summary.test.ts tests/reputation-preview-fallback.test.ts tests/reputation-rail.test.ts && npm run check`

## Next step
- Build a **PRD feature tracker** CSV + JSON (feature → status → evidence link) and render it as a KPI on the Ops dashboard.
