# Decision Record — Solo Go/No-Go Lock

- **Date (IST):** 2026-02-17
- **Decision ID:** DR-2026-02-17-SOLO-GONOGO-LOCK
- **Project:** Credity
- **Owner / Final Authority:** Raghav Badhwar (solo)
- **Scope:** All release go/no-go decisions during current sprint and subsequent releases unless superseded by a newer decision record.

## Decision
1. Go/No-Go is **solo authority** (Raghav only).
2. Every release must include a **signed decision record** in `AEOS_Memory/Decision_Logs/`.
3. No release proceeds without this signed record.

## Rationale
Credity is a trust-layer product; release governance must demonstrate verifiable accountability.

## Enforcement
- Missing signed decision record => **RELEASE BLOCKED**.
- Any gate pass without decision record is non-compliant and invalid.

## Signature Section (to be completed at release time)
- Signer:
- Timestamp (UTC/IST):
- Release SHA / Tag:
- Decision: GO / NO-GO
- Signature / Attestation Ref:
