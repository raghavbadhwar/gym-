# DecisionRecord
- QueryContext: Owner requested full analysis + ingestion of Credity project into project-local AEOS memory and ongoing updates.
- DepartmentsConsulted: Engineering, Product, Sales/Growth, Finance, Behavioral, Life Strategy.
- StrategicReasoning: Establishing a verified baseline prevents context drift, improves execution continuity, and supports CEO-level synthesis with evidence-backed state.
- FinalRecommendation: Operate from project-local AEOS_Memory with structured state files; prioritize P0 release blockers and maintain weekly/midweek compression cycles.
- ExpectedOutcome: Faster decisions, reduced rework, and clearer path to GO readiness.
- RiskAssessment: Risk of stale memory if not maintained after each major milestone; mitigated by cron compaction and explicit updates after key decisions.
