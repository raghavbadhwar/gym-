# DecisionRecord
- QueryContext: User reconfirmed mandatory execution model: AEOS framework, 3 specialist teams (Issuer/Consumer/Recruiter), pod-based parallel delivery, strict non-deviation, and record-keeping discipline.
- DepartmentsConsulted: CEO synthesis with Issuer lane, Consumer lane, Recruiter lane.
- StrategicReasoning: Product complexity requires synchronized pod delivery with contract-first integration and continuous memory logging to prevent drift and rework.
- FinalRecommendation: Lock operating model for this sprint: (1) AEOS reporting, (2) 3 specialist pods only, (3) L3+ quality gate, (4) evidence-only completion, (5) continuous updates to AEOS_Memory decision and operational logs.
- ExpectedOutcome: Faster, reliable convergence of full PRD implementation with minimal integration failures and clear audit trail.
- RiskAssessment: Main risk is process drift under pressure; mitigation is explicit lock + periodic checkpoint updates and shared contract freeze discipline.
