# Weekly Summary — 2026-W07 (Credity)

Date (compiled): 2026-02-15 (IST)

## Weekly Executive Summary (what mattered)
- Established a **verified baseline** for Credity by ingesting repo evidence and structuring project-local AEOS memory (strategic/operational/departmental + decision log).
- Identified the **release readiness center of gravity**: Credity is still **NO-GO** until P0 release gates are green, with the most concrete technical blocker being a **foundation gate nonce mismatch**.
- Captured the strategic charter: Credity’s path is “**UPI for trust**” (India-first verification + fraud prevention) while preserving **W3C DID/VC** compatibility and a **ZK-native** trajectory.

## Key Decisions + Rationale
- **Decision:** Operate from project-local `AEOS_Memory` with weekly (and optional midweek) compression cycles.
  - **Rationale:** Prevent context drift, keep CEO-level synthesis evidence-backed, and reduce rework.
- **Decision:** Prioritize clearing P0 release blockers over net-new feature expansion.
  - **Rationale:** Highest ROI is unlocking a GO path; shipping without evidence-backed gates increases launch risk.

## Wins / Blockers / Risks
### Wins
- Baseline operational state captured with repo ground truth (topology, gates, known blockers).
- Initial PRD progress scaffolding created (feature-level + requirement-level JSON trackers) using an evidence-only standard.

### Blockers
- **Foundation gate failure:** nonce mismatch in OID4VP response flow (needs deterministic reproduction + patch).
- **Evidence freshness gap:** hosted launch / contract-security evidence needs to be refreshed/linked against the current release SHA.
- **External dependencies:** production secrets/secret manager, hosting/domain/DNS, and irreversible chain/wallet signing approvals.

### Risks
- Memory becoming stale if not updated after each material milestone (mitigation: weekly compaction + explicit updates after key decisions/changes).
- Messaging/UX consistency across surfaces (gateway vs issuer/recruiter flows) may remain uneven without a telemetry-backed conversion loop.

## Next-Week Priorities
1. Reproduce and fix **nonce mismatch** (foundation gate) deterministically; document the root cause and verification steps.
2. Refresh **hosted gate evidence** (launch + contract/security) on the current SHA and link artifacts in release boards.
3. Convert PRD progress into a **feature→status→evidence** tracker that is reviewable (CSV/JSON) and ideally visible on the Ops dashboard.
4. Tighten **telemetry** for the gateway trust/conversion narrative (bounce, qualified demo requests, funnel drop-offs).

If this week is considered a setup/ingestion week only: this file is the authoritative weekly snapshot; subsequent weeks should focus on deltas and decisions.
