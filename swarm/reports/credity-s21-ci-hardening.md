# S21 — CI Hardening Report (check/test/contracts/security)

## Scope Completed
Implemented practical CI hardening in `/Users/raghav/Desktop/credity` for quality gates across check, tests, contracts, and dependency security.

## Changes Made

### 1) Added unified quality workflow
**File:** `.github/workflows/quality-gates-ci.yml`

Introduced a new path-aware CI workflow with:
- Triggers: `pull_request`, `push` (`main`/`master`), `workflow_dispatch`
- Least-privilege permissions (`contents: read`)
- Concurrency cancellation to avoid stale duplicate runs
- Change detection via `dorny/paths-filter`
- Matrix-based module execution with `fail-fast: false`
- Job timeouts

Gates implemented:
- **Check gate:**
  - `packages/shared-auth` → `npm run build`
  - `BlockWalletDigi` → `npm run check`
  - `CredVerseIssuer 3` → `npm run check`
  - `CredVerseRecruiter` → `npm run check`
- **Test gate:**
  - `BlockWalletDigi` → `npm test`
  - `CredVerseIssuer 3` → `npm test`
  - `CredVerseRecruiter` → `npm test`
  - `credverse-gateway` → `npm run test:proxy`
  - `apps/mobile` → `npm test`
- **Contracts security gate:**
  - `CredVerseIssuer 3/contracts` → `npm run analyze:static`
- **Dependency security gate:**
  - impacted modules run `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high`

### 2) Hardened existing contracts workflow
**File:** `.github/workflows/contract-security-ci.yml`

Added:
- `permissions: contents: read`
- concurrency group/cancellation
- `timeout-minutes: 20`

### 3) Added gate criteria documentation
**File:** `docs/gates/ci-quality-gates.md`

Documented:
- workflow locations
- exact pass/fail criteria for each gate
- path-aware practicality controls
- operator guidance for manual dispatch and audit exceptions

## Notes / Practical Tradeoffs
- Security auditing is configured for runtime deps (`--omit=dev`) at **high+ severity** to reduce noise while preserving meaningful risk signal.
- Path filtering keeps CI cost/time practical by running jobs only for impacted areas.
- `workflow_dispatch` allows full/manual pre-release sweeps.

## Validation Status
- File-level implementation completed.
- No full CI execution was run from this environment (repo root is not a git worktree in current local context), so runtime workflow validation should occur on next PR/push in GitHub Actions.
