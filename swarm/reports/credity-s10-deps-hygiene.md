# Credity S10 — Dependency & Test Hygiene

## Scope
Worked in `/Users/raghav/Desktop/credity` with a minimal-change approach (no broad version upgrades), focusing on:
- dependency/test hygiene fragility,
- script consistency,
- flaky/fragile test behavior.

## What I found

### 1) Wallet test suite had intermittent auth/compliance failures under parallel execution
- Symptom in full wallet run: `tests/compliance.test.ts` occasionally returned `401` where `201/202` were expected.
- Isolated file run passed consistently.
- Likely cause: shared mutable in-memory test state across files (auth/rate-limit/storage behavior) combined with file-parallel execution.

### 2) Recruiter verification route had a runtime reference issue in full-suite paths
- Symptom: multiple recruiter tests failed with `ReferenceError: deterministicHashLegacyTopLevel is not defined` from `server/routes/verification.ts`.
- Cause: missing import for symbol used in fallback verification path.

### 3) Recruiter tests had brittle expectations around validation/size boundary behavior
- `tests/proof-lifecycle.test.ts` assumed one status in oversized payload scenario; behavior can validly surface as either input-validation or payload-too-large depending on route/middleware ordering.
- E2E verifier mismatch case used too-short `expected_hash` (`deadbeef`), which can hit schema rejection paths instead of deterministic mismatch behavior.

### 4) Recruiter E2E timing sensitivity
- Long-running cross-service E2E test occasionally approached/exceeded default timeout under load.

## Minimal fixes applied

### A) Wallet flake reduction (test runner configuration)
**File:** `BlockWalletDigi/package.json`
- Changed:
  - `"test": "vitest run"`
  - → `"test": "vitest run --no-file-parallelism"`
- Rationale: stabilize suite by removing cross-file state races without changing runtime app logic.

### B) Recruiter missing symbol import
**File:** `CredVerseRecruiter/server/routes/verification.ts`
- Added `deterministicHashLegacyTopLevel` to proof-lifecycle imports.
- Rationale: fixes runtime `ReferenceError` in verification fallback path.

### C) Recruiter proof lifecycle test brittleness
**File:** `CredVerseRecruiter/tests/proof-lifecycle.test.ts`
- Updated oversized metadata assertion to accept either `400` or `413`, while preserving code assertion for `400` path.
- Rationale: removes false failures caused by middleware vs handler ordering while still validating rejection behavior.

### D) Recruiter E2E mismatch vector hygiene
**File:** `CredVerseRecruiter/tests/e2e-issuer-wallet-verifier.test.ts`
- Replaced invalid short hash (`deadbeef`) with a valid-length 64-hex mismatch hash.
- Rationale: ensures test exercises mismatch semantics (`PROOF_HASH_MISMATCH`) instead of schema-length rejection.

### E) Recruiter timeout hardening
**File:** `CredVerseRecruiter/package.json`
- Changed:
  - `"test": "vitest run"`
  - → `"test": "vitest run --testTimeout=15000"`
- Rationale: reduces timeout-related flakes in heavier cross-service E2E tests.

## Checks/tests run

### Passed
- `npm run test:gateway` (root)
- `npm run test:mobile` (root)
- `npm run test:issuer` (root)
- `npm run test:wallet` (root) — after `--no-file-parallelism`
- `npx vitest run tests/proof-lifecycle.test.ts` (Recruiter)
- `npx vitest run tests/oid4vp-wallet-binding.test.ts tests/proof-lifecycle.test.ts tests/w3c-did-vc-conformance.test.ts tests/e2e-issuer-wallet-verifier.test.ts` (Recruiter)

### Notes
- A prior full recruiter run exposed the missing import/runtime error and timeout brittleness; fixes above address those fragility points.
- No dependency upgrades were performed.

## Net result
Applied minimal, safe test-hygiene fixes that improve determinism and reduce CI fragility, while preserving existing feature behavior and avoiding broad dependency churn.
