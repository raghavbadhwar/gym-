# Credity P0D — Hosted CI Evidence Pack Preparation

Date: 2026-02-14 (Asia/Calcutta)
Scope: `/Users/raghav/Desktop/credity` only

## Objective
Prepare a low-risk hosted CI evidence path for release-board GO/NO-GO decisions by:
1. Verifying current workflows.
2. Adding minimal docs/scripts to capture green-run artifacts/links.
3. Mapping evidence to release-board P0 checklist rows.

---

## 1) Workflow verification (current state)

Verified existing workflows:
- `.github/workflows/quality-gates-ci.yml`
  - Path-aware changes job + gates for check/test/contracts/dependency-security.
  - Supports `workflow_dispatch`.
- `.github/workflows/contract-security-ci.yml`
  - Focused contract static analysis pipeline.
- `.github/workflows/launch-gate.yml`
  - Launch-doc/config gate check.

Gap identified before this task:
- Workflows executed gates but did not consistently emit a dedicated evidence artifact for release-board traceability.

---

## 2) Minimal, non-runtime-risk changes applied

### A) Added evidence artifact publishing jobs in hosted CI workflows

Updated files:
- `.github/workflows/quality-gates-ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/contract-security-ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/launch-gate.yml`

What was added:
- New `evidence-pack` job in each workflow.
- Job builds a small markdown summary with:
  - workflow/run metadata
  - run URL (`https://github.com/<repo>/actions/runs/<run_id>`)
  - upstream job results
  - P0 mapping note
- Job uploads summary via `actions/upload-artifact@v4`.

Artifact names:
- `quality-gates-evidence-<run_id>`
- `contract-security-evidence-<run_id>`
- `launch-gate-evidence-<run_id>`

Risk profile:
- Documentation/evidence-only CI enhancement.
- No application runtime codepaths changed.

### B) Added CI evidence-pack generator script

New file:
- `scripts/ci-evidence-pack.mjs`

Purpose:
- Generate a release-board ready markdown pack from hosted run URLs/metadata.

Added root script entry:
- `package.json` -> `"ci:evidence:pack": "node scripts/ci-evidence-pack.mjs"`

Example usage:
```bash
cd /Users/raghav/Desktop/credity
npm run ci:evidence:pack -- \
  --sha=<release_commit_sha> \
  --ref=<release_branch_or_tag> \
  --qualityRun=<quality_run_url> \
  --contractRun=<contract_run_url> \
  --launchRun=<launch_run_url> \
  --out=swarm/reports/ci-evidence-pack.latest.md
```

Validation performed:
- Script executed locally and successfully generated:
  - `swarm/reports/ci-evidence-pack.latest.md`

### C) Added operator documentation for hosted evidence path

New file:
- `docs/gates/hosted-ci-evidence-path.md`

Contents include:
- Workflow/artifact inventory
- Step-by-step hosted CI evidence capture flow
- Command to generate local evidence-pack file
- Explicit mapping to release board rows: P0-03, P0-04, P0-05

Also updated:
- `docs/gates/ci-quality-gates.md`
  - Added pointer to hosted evidence path and quality artifact usage.

---

## 3) GO/NO-GO checklist mapping readiness

Prepared mapping coverage:
- **P0-03 Cross-service quality gates pass**
  - Source: quality-gates-ci + launch-gate run URLs and artifacts.
- **P0-04 CI release workflow validation**
  - Source: quality-gates-ci green run URL + artifact summary.
- **P0-05 Security high/critical sweep**
  - Source: dependency-security + contracts-security job outcomes (quality workflow) plus contract-security-ci artifact.

This creates a repeatable hosted evidence trail for release-board updates without relying on ad-hoc local logs.

---

## 4) Notes / constraints

- Hosted workflows were **prepared** for evidence collection; this task did **not** execute GitHub-hosted runs directly from local context.
- Final GO/NO-GO status still depends on obtaining fresh green runs and attaching actual run URLs/artifacts for the release commit.

---

## Files changed

1. `.github/workflows/quality-gates-ci.yml`
2. `.github/workflows/contract-security-ci.yml`
3. `.github/workflows/launch-gate.yml`
4. `scripts/ci-evidence-pack.mjs` (new)
5. `package.json`
6. `docs/gates/hosted-ci-evidence-path.md` (new)
7. `docs/gates/ci-quality-gates.md`
8. `swarm/reports/ci-evidence-pack.latest.md` (generated sample output)

---

## Outcome
P0D objective completed: hosted CI evidence path is now explicitly defined, minimally automated, and mapped to release-board P0 GO/NO-GO rows with low-risk changes only.
