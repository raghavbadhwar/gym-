# Credity Swarm S07 — Contract Re-Audit Report

**Scope:** `/Users/raghav/Desktop/credity/CredVerseIssuer 3/contracts`

**Target areas:**
- Emergency revoke flow
- Idempotency
- Event integrity
- Access controls

**Date:** 2026-02-14

---

## Executive Summary

Re-audit completed for `CredVerseRegistry.sol` with additional edge-case tests added.

- **Critical:** 0
- **High:** 0
- **Medium:** 0
- **Low:** 0
- **Informational:** 2

Current implementation is generally sound for the requested areas: role boundaries are enforced, emergency admin revocation works, and key state transitions are idempotent.

---

## What was audited

### Contract reviewed
- `contracts/CredVerseRegistry.sol`

### Existing + extended test suite
- `test/CredentialRegistry.test.js`

Extended tests were added to cover:
1. **Event integrity**
   - `IssuerRegistered` payload validation
   - `AnchorSubmitted` timestamp and submitter correctness
   - `CredentialRevoked` timestamp and revoker correctness on admin emergency path
2. **Emergency revoke edge path**
   - Admin can revoke anchored credential after issuer itself is revoked
3. **Access controls**
   - Non-admin blocked from admin-only methods (`registerIssuer`, `revokeIssuer`, `pause`, `unpause`)
4. **Pause behavior + idempotency**
   - State-changing methods blocked while paused
   - Normal behavior resumes after unpause
   - `pause()`/`unpause()` idempotency enforced via expected custom errors

---

## Findings

### INFO-01: Revocation event does not distinguish issuer-revoke vs admin-emergency-revoke

**Severity:** Informational  
**Location:** `event CredentialRevoked(bytes32 indexed credentialHash, address indexed revoker, uint256 timestamp)` + both revoke functions

**Details:**
Both `revokeCredential` (issuer path) and `adminRevokeCredential` (emergency admin path) emit the same event signature. While `revoker` identifies caller, downstream indexers may still benefit from explicit reason/source typing for analytics/compliance.

**Recommendation (optional):**
- Add dedicated event for emergency path, e.g. `CredentialRevokedByAdmin`, or
- Add an enum/flag argument to current event indicating revocation source.

---

### INFO-02: `ContractPaused` custom error is declared but unused

**Severity:** Informational  
**Location:** `error ContractPaused();`

**Details:**
`whenNotPaused` from OpenZeppelin already enforces pause semantics via `EnforcedPause`/`ExpectedPause`. `ContractPaused` is never used.

**Recommendation (optional):**
- Remove dead custom error to reduce ABI clutter, or
- Replace OZ pause checks with custom logic only if a project-specific error surface is required.

---

## Validation Results

Executed in project directory:

```bash
npm run lint:solidity
npm run compile
npm test
```

### Outcomes

- **Solidity lint:** Passed (`solhint`), no rule violations
- **Compile:** Passed
- **Tests:** Passed (`28 passing`)

---

## Files modified

- `test/CredentialRegistry.test.js`
  - Added 7 new tests under `Pause / Access Control / Event Integrity`

No contract source changes were required for this pass.

---

## Conclusion

For the specified audit focus (emergency revoke, idempotency, event integrity, and access control), the contract is functioning correctly and now has stronger regression coverage around previously under-tested edges.
