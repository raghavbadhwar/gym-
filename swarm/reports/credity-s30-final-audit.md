# Credity S30 — Final Technical Audit Snapshot

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-14 17:2x IST (Asia/Calcutta)  
**Scope:** Final release-readiness snapshot (no risky code changes)

## Executive Summary

**Current release decision: `NO-GO`**.

Primary blockers are reproducible in current workspace:
1. TypeScript compile failure in issuer check path.
2. Recruiter cross-service E2E test failure (null `proof` assertion path).
3. Strict launch gate fails due missing required production env vars.
4. CI workflow green-run evidence is still not attached from GitHub Actions runtime.

---

## Command Evidence (Current Head)

### 1) Root quality gates

- `npm test` ❌ **FAIL**
  - Fails at recruiter suite (`CredVerseRecruiter/tests/e2e-issuer-wallet-verifier.test.ts`)
  - Error:
    - `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'deferred')`
    - Location: `tests/e2e-issuer-wallet-verifier.test.ts:176`

- `npm run gate:launch:strict` ❌ **FAIL**
  - Passed docs/runbook checks.
  - Failed required runtime config checks:
    - `REDIS_URL` missing
    - `SENTRY_DSN`/`GATEWAY_SENTRY_DSN` missing
    - `JWT_SECRET` + `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` missing

- `npm run check:wallet && npm run check:issuer && npm run check:recruiter` ❌ **FAIL**
  - Issuer compile error:
    - `server/services/queue-service.ts(204,64): error TS2339: Property 'attemptsMade' does not exist on type '{ jobId: string; failedReason: string; prev?: string | undefined; }'.`

### 2) Security / contracts

- `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high` ✅ **PASS**
  - `found 0 vulnerabilities`

- `npm run gate:contracts:security` ✅ **PASS**
  - Solhint + Hardhat compile + contract tests all green
  - Contract tests: **28 passing**

### 3) Recruiter targeted run

- `npm run test:recruiter` ❌ **FAIL**
  - Same deterministic failing test in E2E proof mode coverage:
    - `covers blockchain proof modes deterministically (active, deferred, writes-disabled)`

## P0 Pass/Fail Snapshot

| P0 ID | Item | Status | Snapshot Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0-01 | Recruiter verification route parse/runtime integrity | 🟩 PASS | Previous syntax-parse blocker (`Unexpected "}"`) not observed in current run; suite executes. |
| P0-02 | Recruiter deterministic full-suite pass | 🟥 FAIL | `npm run test:recruiter` fails with null-proof assertion in cross-service E2E test. |
| P0-03 | Cross-service quality gates pass | 🟥 FAIL | `npm test` fails; check chain fails on issuer TS error; strict launch gate fails. |
| P0-04 | CI release workflow validation (GitHub Actions) | 🟧 PARTIAL | Workflow exists, but no new audited green-run URL/artifact validated in this snapshot. |
| P0-05 | Security high/critical + contract static checks | 🟩 PASS (local) | Local `npm audit` high+ clean and contract security gate passes. |

---

## Known Blockers (Release-Critical)

1. **Issuer TypeScript compile break**
   - File: `CredVerseIssuer 3/server/services/queue-service.ts`
   - Symptom: references `attemptsMade` on a narrowed type without that property.

2. **Recruiter E2E proof-mode test failure**
   - File: `CredVerseRecruiter/tests/e2e-issuer-wallet-verifier.test.ts`
   - Symptom: `proof` is null in at least one mode; test asserts `proof.deferred`.

3. **Strict launch env requirements unmet**
   - Missing required production/staging env signals for launch gate:
     - `REDIS_URL`
     - `SENTRY_DSN` or `GATEWAY_SENTRY_DSN`
     - `JWT_SECRET` and `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`

4. **CI runtime evidence gap**
   - Need current-commit GitHub Actions green evidence for release branch/PR.

## Risk Register

| Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation (Immediate) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Issuer compile-time type break leaks into release branch | High | High | Build/deploy block, hidden runtime drift | Fix typing in queue-service, re-run `npm run check` root and issuer. |
| Recruiter cross-service proof-mode regression | High | High | End-to-end verification reliability compromised | Add null-guard/fixture correction in E2E path, enforce deterministic proof fixture setup, rerun recruiter + root tests. |
| Launch gate env gaps in staging/prod | High | Medium | No observability, weak auth secret posture, queue features disabled | Provision secrets in env manager, verify via `npm run gate:launch:strict`. |
| CI gate not validated on hosted runner | Medium | Medium | Local-only confidence; release drift risk | Execute release workflow on GH Actions and attach logs/artifacts. |
| Deferred blockchain mode masking integration behavior | Medium | Medium | Production mismatch if on-chain writes enabled later | Run one staged pass with representative chain config + relayer configured. |

## Immediate Next 24h Plan (Priority Ordered)

1. **Unblock compile gate (P0):**
   - Patch issuer `queue-service.ts` type mismatch (`attemptsMade` contract).
   - Re-run: `npm run check:issuer`, then root `npm run check`.

2. **Unblock recruiter deterministic test gate (P0):**
   - Debug failing test at line 176; ensure proof object creation contract remains stable for all modes.
   - Re-run: `npm run test:recruiter` until stable across 2 consecutive runs.

3. **Re-run root test gate (P0):**
   - `npm test` and archive output.

4. **Close strict launch gate (P0):**
   - Set required env vars in launch profile/secrets store.
   - Re-run: `npm run gate:launch:strict` and capture pass artifact.

5. **Close CI evidence gap (P0):**
   - Trigger `.github/workflows/quality-gates-ci.yml` on release candidate commit.
   - Attach workflow URL + artifacts to release board.

6. **Final evidence pack assembly:**
   - Include command logs for `check`, `test`, `gate:launch:strict`, `audit`, contract gate, CI link.
   - Update `swarm/reports/credity-s28-release-board.md` statuses to final GO/NO-GO.

## Audit Conclusion

As of this snapshot, Credity is **not release-ready**. Security scan and contract static checks are green, but P0 engineering and launch gate blockers remain open. Clearing the listed 24h actions should provide a definitive next GO/NO-GO decision with full evidence.
