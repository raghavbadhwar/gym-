# Credity P0A — Issuer attemptsMade Type Fix

## Scope
Worked only in `/Users/raghav/Desktop/credity`.

## Minimal patch applied
### File changed
- `CredVerseIssuer 3/server/services/queue-service.ts`

### Change summary
In the BullMQ worker `failed` handler, normalized `job.attemptsMade` into a guaranteed numeric value before using it in retry logic and dead-letter payload construction.

#### Before
```ts
const attemptsMade = job.attemptsMade;
const hasRetriesRemaining = attemptsMade < configuredAttempts;
```

#### After
```ts
const attemptsMadeRaw = job.attemptsMade;
const attemptsMade = typeof attemptsMadeRaw === 'number' && Number.isFinite(attemptsMadeRaw)
    ? attemptsMadeRaw
    : 0;
const hasRetriesRemaining = attemptsMade < configuredAttempts;
```

## Behavior impact
- Intended behavior unchanged for valid numeric `attemptsMade` values.
- Adds defensive typing/runtime safety for non-numeric/unknown values.

## Commands run

### 1) `npm run check:issuer` (from repo root)
Command started and reached:
- `cd "CredVerseIssuer 3" && npm run check`
- `tsc`

Observed state: long-running `tsc` process with no additional output; manually terminated.

### 2) `npm run check` (from repo root)
Command started and reached:
- `npm run check:shared-auth && npm run check:wallet && npm run check:issuer && npm run check:recruiter`
- entered `check:shared-auth`
- `packages/shared-auth` → `npm run build` → `tsc`

Observed state: long-running `tsc` process with no additional output; manually terminated.

## Notes
- Patch is minimal and localized to the issuer queue service typing hotspot around `attemptsMade`.
