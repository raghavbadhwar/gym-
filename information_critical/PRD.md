## 1. PRODUCT VISION & STRATEGY

### 1.1 Vision Statement

"To become the universal trust layer for the internet, making every digital interaction verifiable and fraud-proof."

By 2030, Credity will be the invisible infrastructure that powers trust online—like Stripe powers payments, Credity powers verification.

### 1.2 Mission Statement

"We rebuild trust in human interactions by making truth verifiable in real-time, protecting businesses from fraud while preserving individual privacy."

### 1.3 Strategic Positioning

Credity owns the "Enterprise Complete Fraud Prevention" quadrant.

**Key Differentiators:**

1. **Complete Solution:** Identity + Claims + Evidence (competitors do only 1)
2. **Multi-Industry:** Insurance, e-commerce, platforms (competitors are vertical-specific)
3. **B2B SaaS Model:** Predictable revenue (competitors rely on tokens or enterprise-only pricing)
4. **Global from Day 1:** Works with or without government digital ID systems
5. **Privacy-First:** Zero-knowledge proofs, user control, encrypted storage
6. **Reputation, Not Just Identity:** Competitors prove you're human. Credity proves you're trustworthy. Cross-platform reputation scoring (WorkScore, SafeDate, TenantScore) creates a network effect moat that identity-only players cannot replicate.

### 1.4 Strategic Principles

1. **Build for Enterprises, Enable Consumers**
   - Primary revenue: B2B (platforms pay)
   - Consumer benefit: Portable identity
   - Network effects: More platforms = more value

2. **Government Integration is Optional, Not Required**
   - DigiLocker in India: Competitive advantage
   - Manual scanning globally: Core functionality
   - Adapt to local systems as they emerge

3. **Complete Solution > Point Solution**
   - Never just identity (too commoditized)
   - Always identity + claims + evidence
   - Add value competitors can't replicate

4. **Trust Through Transparency**
   - Show users exactly what's shared
   - Explain why we need each data point
   - Give users control over their data

5. **Scale Through Network Effects**
   - Each verification makes AI smarter
   - Each platform integration increases value
   - "Verify once, use everywhere" drives adoption

### 2.2 Competitive Landscape

#### Direct Competitors

**Humanity Protocol**
- **Focus:** Web3 identity verification via palm scan + ZK proofs on Polygon CDK
- **Funding:** $20M at $1.1B valuation (Pantera Capital, Jump Crypto)
- **Status:** Mainnet live, 2M verified users, $H token launched (ERC-20, 10B supply)
- **Key Partnerships:** Mastercard (privacy-preserving KYC), Animoca Brands, OKX Wallet, Polygon Labs

**Strengths:**
- Mastercard partnership gives real-world financial utility
- "Less invasive" biometric narrative vs Worldcoin (palm > iris)
- Horizontal SDK play — positioning as developer infrastructure, not consumer app
- ZK-proofs used as a marketing weapon ("We never see your data")
- Polygon co-founder (Sandeep Nailwal) is a "Founding Human"

**Weaknesses:**
- Web3-only focus (ignoring $120B enterprise market)
- Only verifies identity (no claims/evidence/reputation validation)
- $0 SaaS revenue (entirely token-dependent — crashes with crypto market)
- Founder admitted ~88% of initial signups were bots
- $H token dropped 85% in 48 hours post-launch
- No cross-platform reputation system (proves you're human, not trustworthy)
- "zkProofer Nodes" are centralized bottleneck disguised as decentralized

**Our Advantage:** We target enterprise (100x bigger market), solve the COMPLETE problem (identity + claims + evidence + reputation), have real SaaS revenue, and prove trustworthiness — not just existence.

**Worldcoin**
- **Focus:** Iris scanning for Web3 identity
- **Funding:** $250M+ (backed by Sam Altman)

**Weaknesses:**
- Insurance-only (can't expand to other verticals)
- $1M+ contracts (too expensive for SMBs)

- Static identity verification
- No fraud detection
- No claims validation
- Document verification only

**Reality Defender, Sensity (Deepfake Detection):**

- No identity layer
- Security tools, not platforms
- Don't integrate into workflows

**Dating App Verification (Tinder, Bumble):** 🆕
- Basic photo verification (selfie = profile pic)
- No background checks
- No cross-platform reputation
- High bot/fake profile rates (40-50%)
- Users willing to pay for better verification

**Our Advantage:** Complete verification (identity + reputation + background), cross-platform portability, SafeDate scoring, B2B2C model.

#### Competitive Summary

|---|---|---|---|---|
| Humanity Protocol | Web3 | $10B | Crypto-only, no claims validation, $0 revenue | Enterprise focus, complete solution, SaaS revenue |
| Worldcoin | Web3 | $10B | Privacy issues, hardware, banned countries | Software-only, privacy-first, global |
| Shift Technology | Insurance | $32B | Vertical-specific, $1M+ pricing | Multi-industry, SMB-friendly pricing |
| Onfido/Jumio | Identity | $16B | Static verification, no fraud detection | Continuous verification + fraud prevention |
| Reality Defender | Security | $5B | Point solution, no identity | Complete platform with identity |
| Dating Apps | Dating/Social | $5B | Basic photo verification only | Complete trust + reputation + SafeDate |

## 6. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### 6.1 Architecture Philosophy: "Hub & Spoke" Model 🆕

**Design Principle:** ONE Core Platform (Reputation Rail) + Multiple Lightweight Vertical UX Layers

Think **Stripe for payments** → **Credity for trust**. One backend infrastructure powers all verticals.

Spokes: Vertical-specific React apps (thin UI wrappers)
Hub: Shared infrastructure (scoring, graph, blockchain)
```

**Why This Works:**
1. **No Code Duplication:** Verification logic written once
2. **Vertical Isolation:** Dating data never leaks to hiring platforms
3. **Network Effects:** More verticals = more reputation data = better scores
4. **Operating Leverage:** Add new vertical = 80% margin (minimal dev cost)
---

### 6.1.1 SDK-First Distribution (Learned from Humanity Protocol)

**Principle:** The SDK is the product. The apps are demos of the SDK.

**`@credverse/trust` SDK (npm package):**
- Single package for all verticals
- 3-line integration for any Node.js/React app
- Returns Trust Score + Recommendation in <2 seconds

**Integration Example:**
```typescript
import { CredVerse } from '@credverse/trust';

const cv = new CredVerse({ apiKey: 'cv_live_xxx' });

// One line to verify
const result = await cv.verify({
  userId: 'user_123',
  vertical: 'DATING',         // or 'HIRING', 'RENTAL', etc.
  requiredScore: 70
});

// result = { score: 87, recommendation: 'APPROVE', zkProof: '0x...' }
```

**Why SDK-First Wins:**
- Humanity Protocol raised $20M selling SDKs. We can do the same with real revenue.
- Platforms integrate once, locked in forever (switching cost = re-engineering)
- Every SDK install = a billboard ("Verified by Credity" badge)

- Navigation: Expo Router (file-based)
- UI: React Native Paper + shadcn/ui (native)
- Styling: Tailwind (NativeWind)
- Camera: expo-camera
- Biometrics: react-native-biometrics
- **ZK Proofs:** snarkjs (client-side proof generation)

**Web Apps (React + Vite)**
- Framework: React 18 with Vite
- Language: TypeScript 5.0+
- State: TanStack Query + Zustand
- UI: shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- Forms: React Hook Form + Zod validation

- Team expertise (one language, one framework)
- Fast iteration with Vite/Expo hot reload

---

#### ⚙️ Backend Layer

**Core API Services (Node.js + TypeScript)**
- Runtime: Node.js 20 LTS
- Framework: Express.js OR Fastify (migration option)
- Language: TypeScript 5.0+
- **API Layer:** tRPC v10+ (type-safe APIs, end-to-end TypeScript)
- Validation: Zod (shared schemas with frontend)
- **Queue:** BullMQ + Upstash Redis (background jobs)
- ORM: Drizzle ORM (for PostgreSQL)

**Why tRPC:**
```typescript
// Backend defines API
export const router = t.router({
  getWorkScore: t.procedure
    .input(z.object({ userId: z.string() }))
    .query(async ({ input }) => {
      return await calculateWorkScore(input.userId);
    }),
});

// Frontend gets FULL type safety (autocomplete, compile-time errors)
const { data } = trpc.getWorkScore.useQuery({ userId: 'user_123' });
//      ^──── TypeScript knows exact return type!
```

**Services Architecture (Monorepo):**
```

#### 🗄️ Database Layer

**1. PostgreSQL 16+ (Primary Relational DB)**
- Managed: Neon or Supabase (serverless Postgres)
- ORM: Drizzle ORM
- Use Cases:
  - User accounts, authentication
  - Verifications, documents
  - Platform registrations
  - Transactions, billing

**2. Neo4j Community Edition (Reputation Graph) 🆕**
- Purpose: Trust graph, cross-vertical relationships
- Why Graph DB: Reputation IS a graph problem
- Deployment: Self-hosted on GCP Compute Engine
- Cost: ~₹3-15K/month

**Graph Schema Example:**
```cypher
// Nodes
(User)-[:VERIFIED_ON]->(Platform)
(User)-[:HAS_SCORE {vertical: "WORK", score: 850}]->(Vertical)
(User)-[:EMPLOYED_AT]->(Company)
(Company)-[:RATED {score: 4.5}]->(User)

// Cross-vertical query (O(1) in graph vs O(n) in SQL)
MATCH (u:User {id: "user_123"})-[r]->(p)
WHERE r.vertical IN ["WORK", "RENTAL", "DATING"]
RETURN r.score, r.signals
```

**Why Neo4j for Reputation:**
- "Find all platforms User A verified on" = graph traversal (instant)
- Cross-vertical signal aggregation = native graph operation
- Fraud detection = pattern matching in graph
- Scales to billions of relationships

**3. TimescaleDB (Time-Series Events) 🆕**
- Purpose: Reputation events over time
- Implementation: PostgreSQL extension (same DB as primary)
- Use Cases:
  - Reputation event stream (millions/day)
  - Score trend analysis
  - Retention policies (auto-delete old events)

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE reputation_events (
  time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  user_id TEXT,
  event_type TEXT,
  vertical TEXT,
  score_delta INT,
  metadata JSONB
);

SELECT create_hypertable('reputation_events', 'time');

-- Score trend (6 months)
SELECT time_bucket('1 month', time) AS month,
       AVG(score_delta)
FROM reputation_events  
WHERE user_id = 'user_123' AND vertical = 'WORK'
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month DESC LIMIT 6;
```

**4. Redis (Upstash) - Cache + Queues**
- Serverless Redis (pay per request)
- Use Cases:
  - API response caching
  - Rate limiting
  - Session storage
  - BullMQ job queues
- Cost: ₹1-5K/month

---

#### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization 🆕

**User Auth (B2C):**
- Provider: **Clerk** (recommended) OR Auth0
- Why Clerk:
  - Multi-tenancy support (B2B + B2C)
  - Social auth + Aadhaar integration
  - Organization/team management built-in
  - Webhooks for user lifecycle events
  - Cost: ₹0-5K/month for 10K users

**Platform API Keys (B2B):**
- Provider: **Unkey** (API key management)
- Features:
  - Rate limiting per platform
  - Usage analytics
  - Key rotation
  - Vertical scoping (WorkScore keys can't access SafeDate)
  - Cost: ₹0-2K/month

**packages/shared-auth:**
- Centralized auth logic across all services
- JWT validation helpers
- Permission checking
- Platform verification

---

### 6.4 Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Privacy Layer 🆕

**The Problem ZK Solves:**
```
Without ZK:
  Employer: "Prove WorkScore > 800"
  User: "My score is 850"
  Employer sees: Exact score (privacy leak)

With ZK:
  Employer: "Prove WorkScore > 800"
  User: "Here's ZK proof"
  Employer learns: ONLY that score > 800 is TRUE
  Information leaked: ZERO
```

**Implementation:**

**Blockchain: Polygon zkEVM**
- Native ZK rollup (Ethereum-compatible)
- PLONK proof system
- Cost: ₹0.05/transaction (50% cheaper than Polygon PoS)
- Production-ready (launched 2023)

**ZK Framework:**
- Circuits: **circom** or **noir** (ZK circuit language)
- Proof Generation: **snarkjs** (client-side, 2-5 seconds)
- Verification: On-chain (smart contract) + off-chain (API)

**ZK Use Cases:**

**1. Selective Score Disclosure:**
```typescript
// User proves: "WorkScore > 750" without revealing exact score
const proof = await generateZKProof({
  privateInput: { actualScore: 850, salt: randomBytes(32) },
  publicClaim: { threshold: 750 },
  circuit: 'score_threshold'
});

// Employer verifies
const isValid = await verifyZKProof(proof);
// Result: TRUE (score > 750)
// Leaked info: ZERO (employer doesn't know if score is 751 or 900)
```

**2. Age Verification (Aadhaar without PII):**
```typescript
// Prove age > 18 without revealing birthdate or Aadhaar
const proof = await generateZKProof({
  privateInput: { aadhaar: 'xxxx', dob: '1998-03-15' },
  publicClaim: { isOver18: true },
  circuit: 'age_verification'
});

// Dating app verifies age WITHOUT storing Aadhaar (GDPR/DPDP perfect)
```

**3. Cross-Vertical Aggregation:**
```typescript
// Prove: "Good reputation in 3+ verticals" without revealing which ones
const proof = await generateZKProof({
  privateInput: { workScore: 850, safeDate: 92, tenantScore: 88 },
  publicClaim: { minVerticals: 3, avgScore: 85 },
  circuit: 'cross_vertical_aggregate'
});
```

**ZK Smart Contract (Verifier):**
```solidity
// Polygon zkEVM
contract ReputationVerifier {
  IVerifier public zkVerifier;  // Generated by circom
  
  mapping(bytes32 => bool) public proofExists;
  
  function verifyAndStoreProof(
    uint[2] calldata pA,
    uint[2][2] calldata pB,
    uint[2] calldata pC,
    uint[1] calldata pubSignals  // [threshold]
  ) external returns (bool) {
    bool isValid = zkVerifier.verifyProof(pA, pB, pC, pubSignals);
    require(isValid, "Invalid ZK proof");
    
    bytes32 proofHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(pA, pB, pC));
    proofExists[proofHash] = true;
    
    return true;
  }
}
```

**Privacy Guarantees:**
- Math-based privacy (not just policy-based)
- Impossible to extract private data from proof
- GDPR/DPDP compliant by design
- User holds proofs locally (no centralized PII storage)

**Cost Analysis:**
- Proof generation: Free (client-side, 2-5 seconds)
- Proof verification (on-chain): ₹0.05/proof
- Annual cost (10K proofs/day): ₹1.8L (vs ₹3.6L on Polygon PoS)

### 6.5 Cross-Vertical Reputation Architecture 🆕

**Core Innovation:** Behavioral signals transfer across verticals with privacy preservation.

**Architecture:**

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ RAW REPUTATION EVENTS (Private, Vertical-Specific)       │
│ • Rental: "Paid ₹25K rent on Jan 1, 2026"                │
│ • Work: "Rated 4.5/5 by manager"                          │
│ • Dating: "Zero harassment reports in 2 years"            │
└───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘
                            │
                    Abstraction Layer
                            ↓
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ BEHAVIORAL SIGNALS (Abstracted, Cross-Vertical)          │
│ • Financial Reliability: 95/100                           │
│ • Communication Skills: 88/100                            │
│ • Conflict Resolution: 92/100                             │
│ • Trustworthiness: 90/100                                 │
│ • Professionalism: 87/100                                 │
└───────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘
                            │
                 Vertical-Specific Weighting
                            ↓
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ VERTICAL SCORES (Domain-Specific, User Controlled)       │
│ • WorkScore: 850/1000 (70% work + 30% cross-vertical)    │
│ • SafeDate: 92/100 (80% dating + 20% cross-vertical)     │
│ • TenantScore: 100/100 (60% rental + 40% cross-vertical) │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Example: Tenant Behavior → WorkScore**

```javascript
// Priya's rental history (PRIVATE)
const rentalEvents = {
  payments: 36,  // 36 months on-time
  landlordRating: 4.8,
  propertyDamage: 0,
  disputeResolution: 'amicable'
};

// Extract character traits (ABSTRACTED)
const traits = {
  financialReliability: 98/100,  // From payments
  responsibility: 95/100,         // From property care
  communication: 92/100,          // From rating
  longTermCommitment: 85/100      // From 3-year tenure
};

// Apply to WorkScore (30% weight for cross-vertical)
const workScore = (
  directWorkSignals * 0.70 +  // 776 points
  crossVerticalBoost * 0.30    // +70 points from rental
) = 846/1000

// What employer sees:
// "WorkScore: 846/1000"
// "Character: Excellent (enhanced by verified behavior in other contexts)"

// What employer DOESN'T see:
// - Rent amount (₹25K)
// - Landlord name/address
// - Lease dates/terms
```

**Authority & Vertical Isolation:**

```javascript
// Platform Registration (One-time KYC)
const platform = {
  id: 'naukri_india_pvt_ltd',
  type: 'HIRING',
  verified: true,  // We verify it's real Naukri
  allowedScopes: ['WORK_SCORE', 'EMPLOYMENT_HISTORY'],
  deniedScopes: ['SAFE_DATE', 'TENANT_SCORE'],  // Cannot touch
  apiKey: 'pk_live_naukri_xyz123'
};

// Reputation Event Submission
POST /api/reputation/events
Headers: Authorization: Bearer pk_live_naukri_xyz123
{
  userId: 'user_12345',
  eventType: 'EMPLOYMENT_RATING',
  vertical: 'HIRING',  // Must match allowed scopes
  data: { rating: 4.5, skills: ['React'], tenure: '2_years' },
  signature: 'blockchain_signature_abc'  // Anti-tampering
}

// Reputation Rail validates:
// ✅ Is Naukri verified to write HIRING data? YES
// ✅ Is signature valid? YES
// ✅ Is employer (Flipkart) verified? YES
// ❌ Can Naukri write SAFE_DATE data? NO (rejected)
```

**Network Effects Moat:**
```
Value = (# verticals)² × (# platforms/vertical) × (data depth)

Example:
- 10 verticals × 5 platforms = 50 integrations
- 50² = 2,500 cross-enrichment pathways
- Competitor needs 2,500 partnerships to match (10+ years)
```

   - **Channel:** Direct sales to Operations Heads, industry conferences

3. **Tertiary: Consumer Adoption (Viral Growth)**
   - Students/Graduates (job verification)
   - Dating app users (safety)
   - **Channel:** Influencer marketing, "Verified" badge viral loops

### 7.2 Dating App GTM Strategy (Priority Track) 🆕

**Why Dating Apps First:**
- Users WANT to be verified (unlike B2B where you push)
- Viral growth potential (verified users get 3x more matches)
- Fast implementation (2-4 week integration)
- High willingness to pay (both B2B and B2C)

**Phase 1: India Dating App Pilots (Month 1-3)**

**Target Partners (in order):**
1. **Woo** - India-focused, 10M+ users, open to innovation
2. **Aisle** - Premium Indian dating, safety-focused, 5M+ users
3. **QuackQuack** - Tier 2/3 cities, 20M+ users

**Pilot Offer:**
- Free integration (we handle engineering)
- Free verifications for first 10,000 users
- 90-day exclusivity in exchange
- Data sharing for A/B testing

**Success Metrics for Pilot:**
- 60% reduction in reported fake profiles
- 3x match rate increase for verified users
- 70%+ verification completion rate
- Net Promoter Score (NPS) >40

**Phase 2: Revenue Activation (Month 4-6)**
- Platform pays ₹8 per verification (starts Month 4)
- Launch SafeDate Premium for consumers (₹149/month)
- Target: 100K verifications, 5K paid subscribers

**Phase 3: Network Effects (Month 7-12)**
- Expand to 5-7 more dating apps
- "Verified by Credity" becomes recognizable
- Cross-platform reputation starts working
- Users demand verification on new platforms

**Messaging:**
**To Dating Apps:**
"Reduce fake profiles by 60%, increase user trust, and improve match rates — all with a 2-week integration."

**To Users:**
"Get 3x more matches and meet verified, safe people. Verify once, trusted everywhere."

**Competitive Moat:**
Once 3+ dating apps integrate, verified users won't switch to apps WITHOUT Credity. Network lock-in.

**Anti-Gaming Safeguards (Learned from Humanity Protocol's Bot Crisis):**
1. **No Token/Cash Incentives for Signups:** Value = utility (3x matches), never money
2. **Device Fingerprinting:** One verification per physical device
3. **Phone OTP Required:** Prevents automated mass-registration
4. **Behavioral Validation:** Require at least 1 platform connection (Uber/LinkedIn) to activate score — bots don't have real Uber accounts
5. **Graduated Trust:** New users start at Score 50, not 0. Score only improves with real cross-platform data, not referrals

### 7.2 Sales Strategy

1. **Self-Service PLG (Product-Led Growth)**
   - Free developer API (100 verifications/month)
   - Simple documentation
   - "Start verifying in 5 minutes" promise
   - Drive usage -> Upgrade to enterprise

2. **Direct Sales (Enterprise)**
   - Targeted outreach to VPs of Trust & Safety
   - Consultative selling ("Let's analyze your fraud loss")
   - PoC (Proof of Concept) model: "Free 30-day trial, pay if we save you money"

### 7.3 Marketing Strategy

1. **Content Marketing:** Reports on "State of Fraud 2025", "Deepfake Prevention Guide"
2. **Trust Badges:** "Verified by Credity" badge on partner sites acts as billboard
3. **Community:** Developer hackathons for fraud prevention tools
4. **PR:** Stories about "AI vs. AI" (Our AI fighting fraud AI)

| Dating Platforms (3 partners) | 5M verifications | ₹8 | ₹4 Cr |
| **Total Year 1** | | | **₹7 Cr** |

**Year 2 (India + SEA Expansion):**
| Revenue Stream | Monthly Users/Txns | Unit Price | Annual Revenue |
|----------------|-------------------|------------|----------------|
| B2B Verification | 200K verifications | ₹50 | ₹12 Cr |

## 10. RISKS & MITIGATION

1. **Risk: Regulatory Changes**
   - *Impact:* High (Government bans private ID verifiers)
   - *Mitigation:* Integrate WITH government systems (DigiLocker) rather than replacing them. Becoming an aggregator.

2. **Risk: AI Arms Race**
   - *Impact:* Medium (Fraudsters' AI becomes better than our detection)
   - *Mitigation:* Feedback loops—every fraud attempt caught trains our model. Partnerships with top AI research labs.

3. **Risk: Privacy Breach**
   - *Impact:* Critical (Loss of trust kills company)
   - *Mitigation:* Zero-knowledge architecture. We don't store PII if possible. Audit logs on blockchain.

4. **Risk: Adoption Resistance**
   - *Impact:* Medium (Users don't want another app)
   - *Mitigation:* Embed directly into partner apps (SDK) first, standalone app second.

## 11. LAUNCH PLAN

**Phase 0: Pre-Launch — "Claim Your Reputation" Campaign (Month -2 to 0)**
- Landing page: "Reserve your @username on the Reputation Rail"
- Allow users to link Uber/LinkedIn/Swiggy to generate a "Preview Score"
- Leaderboard: "Top 100 most trusted users get Early Adopter badge"
- Target: 10,000 pre-registrations before Alpha launch
- Anti-bot: Device fingerprinting + phone OTP required (no token incentives)
- Focus: Build a waitlist AND validate platform connection APIs simultaneously
- *Lesson from Humanity Protocol: They got 50K pre-launch signups. But 88% were bots because they used token incentives. We use UTILITY incentives instead (your score improves with more connections → better matches/jobs).*

**Phase 1: Alpha (Months 1-3)**
- Build MVP (Identity + Document Scan)
- Partner with 5 design partners (mid-sized startups)
- Manual onboarding
- Focus: Stability and accuracy

**Phase 2: Beta (Months 4-6)**
- Launch Self-Service Developer Portal
- Add "Trust Score" algorithm
- Public launch on Product Hunt
- Focus: Developer experience and bug fixing

**Phase 3: Public Launch (Months 7-12)**
- Full Sales & Marketing push
- Introduce "Evidence Authentication" layer
- Series A fundraising preparation
- Focus: Scale and revenue
