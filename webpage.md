## SECTION 3: WHAT WE DO (STICKY SCROLL SECTION)

### Concept
This section uses **Sticky + Scroll Variants** — The left side stays sticky showing the current feature visual while the right side scrolls through 3 features.

### Layout
```
┌────────────────────┬─────────────────────┐
│                    │                     │
│   STICKY VISUAL    │   SCROLLING TEXT    │
│   (Changes based   │   Feature 1         │
│   on scroll)       │   Feature 2         │
│                    │   Feature 3         │
│                    │                     │
└────────────────────┴─────────────────────┘
```

### How It Works
- Container height: 300vh (3 viewport heights for 3 sections)
- Left panel: position sticky, top 50%, transform Y -50%
- Right panel: 3 content blocks, each 100vh
- As each block enters viewport, the sticky visual transforms to match

### Feature 1: Identity Verification
**When Scroll Position: 0-33%**
- Visual: Animated face scan with checkmark appearing
- Title: "Know exactly who you're dealing with"
- Description: "Verify any Indian in under 5 seconds using DigiLocker, Aadhaar, PAN, or document verification. AI-powered liveness detection catches spoofs and deepfakes."
- Accent: Emerald green elements

### Feature 2: Fraud Detection  
**When Scroll Position: 33-66%**
- Visual: Shield icon with scanning radar animation
- Title: "Catch fraud before it costs you crores"
- Description: "Our AI analyzes documents, videos, and data patterns to detect forgeries, deepfakes, and inconsistencies that humans miss."
- Accent: Coral red elements
- Visual shakes slightly (danger effect)

### Feature 3: Trust Scores
**When Scroll Position: 66-100%**
- Visual: Large circular gauge filling up, number counting to 847
- Title: "Portable reputation across India"
- Description: "Help users build their Vishwas Score™ — a trust rating they can carry from job to job, platform to platform."
- Accent: Amber gold elements

### Transitions Between

```

### Typography
- Numbers: Clash Display 600, 120px, Snow color

### Animations

2. **Number Counter:** Each number counts up from 0 when section is 50% in view
   - 513M counts up over 2.5 seconds
   - 5 counts up over 1 second  
   - 2 counts up over 1.5 seconds
